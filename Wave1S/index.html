          <p>For over 90 years, RSM has been driven in their mission to give back by supporting local communities, with over $36 million dollars donated to organizations benefitting children and families. The RSM Classic, hosted by Davis Love III and the Davis Love Foundation, shares our vision of what it means to give back. The Power of Love campaign, as RSM&rsquo;s annual stewardship program, engages employees and friends of the firm to give back in their local communities, and is supported by a generous match from the RSM US Foundation. See what a difference the Power of Love made&nbsp;in&nbsp;2022.</p>
